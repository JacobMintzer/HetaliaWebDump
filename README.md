# Hetalia Web Dump
For the past 2 or so months I have been web crawling the hetalia website trying to get all of the hidden files and have compiled what I found here.

I should have everything that was easily accessible on the website as of about 30 minutes before it went down, and a number of files that were not as easily findable. 

If you just want the files, and are not familiar with github, you can download them by clicking [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1AyEArw6uqoqWvUDHyeUNAccaqmIxBYAB) (let me know if this link goes down) and the zip file will contain all the files as well as the metadata (date created). Alternatively, if you don't care about the metadata, you can click *Clone or Download => Download Zip*

When i did my webcrawling, to cut down on the time needed to get as much as I could, I didn't check the file extension, so I assumed all the files are '.gif' files, which is true for most of them, but not all. I have raw files in the folder meta, and the gif/corrected versions in CleanedFiles. If you notice one of the files is wrong in CleanedFiles, please e-mail me at **JrMintz3@gmail.com** and I will fix it as soon as I can.

If there are any requests, or problems feel free to e-mail me and I will help any way I can. Enjoy!
